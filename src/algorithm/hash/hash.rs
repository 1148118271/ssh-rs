/// https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4253#section-7.2
///
/// The key exchange produces two values: a shared secret K, and an
/// exchange hash H.  Encryption and authentication keys are derived from
/// these.  The exchange hash H from the first key exchange is
/// additionally used as the session identifier, which is a unique
/// identifier for this connection.  It is used by authentication methods
/// as a part of the data that is signed as a proof of possession of a
/// private key.  Once computed, the session identifier is not changed,
/// even if keys are later re-exchanged.

/// Each key exchange method specifies a hash function that is used in
/// the key exchange.  The same hash algorithm MUST be used in key
/// derivation.  Here, we'll call it HASH.

/// Encryption keys MUST be computed as HASH, of a known value and K, as
/// follows:

/// o  Initial IV client to server: HASH(K || H || "A" || session_id)
///    (Here K is encoded as mpint and "A" as byte and session_id as raw
///    data.  "A" means the single character A, ASCII 65).

/// o  Initial IV server to client: HASH(K || H || "B" || session_id)

/// o  Encryption key client to server: HASH(K || H || "C" || session_id)

/// o  Encryption key server to client: HASH(K || H || "D" || session_id)

/// o  Integrity key client to server: HASH(K || H || "E" || session_id)

/// o  Integrity key server to client: HASH(K || H || "F" || session_id)

/// Key data MUST be taken from the beginning of the hash output.  As
/// many bytes as needed are taken from the beginning of the hash value.
/// If the key length needed is longer than the output of the HASH, the
/// key is extended by computing HASH of the concatenation of K and H and
/// the entire key so far, and appending the resulting bytes (as many as
/// HASH generates) to the key.  This process is repeated until enough
/// key material is available; the key is taken from the beginning of
/// this value.  In other words:

///    K1 = HASH(K || H || X || session_id)   (X is e.g., "A")
///    K2 = HASH(K || H || K1)
///    K3 = HASH(K || H || K1 || K2)
///    ...
///    key = K1 || K2 || K3 || ...

/// This process will lose entropy if the amount of entropy in K is
/// larger than the internal state size of HASH.
